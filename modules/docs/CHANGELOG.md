### Minor Changes

- 2ab05df: Bemmoly takes on its logo's colours and a quieter visual system. The accent is the logo blue
  (the mid blue in dark mode), AI is the logo lilac and nothing else, and epics have their own
  violet. Every text grey now reads at 4.5:1 or better on every surface in every theme, so muted
  text that was hard to read is fixed everywhere at once, and the Midnight and Ocean themes get
  readable primary buttons. Type, radii and shadows are fewer and consistent.

  Icons are drawn instead of typed, so they look the same on every computer: issue types are
  tiles with a drawn mark, priority is three neutral bars with only the most urgent level in red,
  and keyboard shortcuts are drawn keys ("Ctrl" off Apple platforms). Custom issue types show
  their own icon and colour instead of a task's, and Settings › Issue types shows every type's
  icon rather than a stored character. Status pills follow their category, so In review and QA
  read as in progress (blue). Avatars are solid colours with white initials, labels are outlined
  pills with their own colour, and project, team and module tiles share one shape.

  Workspace logo colours no longer recolour the Bemmoly mark under a custom theme. Tooltips name
  their shortcut, deleting something reversible shows Undo for six seconds, relative times show
  the full date on hover, and every keyboard focus shows the same ring.

  Workflow status colours stored by earlier versions are drawn as their nearest new colour, and
  the issue type icon field now takes an icon name of up to 40 characters. No configuration or
  schema change.

- 259e195: Every signed-in screen now sits in one frame: a sidebar with the Bemmoly mark and your workspace,
  Search and New, Home, Inbox and My issues, then Work's projects with their Board, Backlog and
  Settings and Docs' spaces, with Settings, Help, the version and your account at the foot. The top
  bar is gone. Press `[` to fold the sidebar to a narrow rail (it remembers), and on a phone the
  sidebar opens from the menu button with a bottom bar for Home, Inbox, New and My issues. Settings
  use the same sidebar, and Esc takes you back to where you were.

  Creating opens over the page you are on instead of taking you elsewhere. ⌘K shows what you opened
  recently and what the current screen can do, Tab filters it by type, and `?` lists every
  shortcut, including C for a new issue, `/` to search and G chords to move between places.

  The Inbox is a two-pane triage view: Mentions, Reviews and Assigned segments, items grouped by
  day, the issue itself beside each item, and J/K to move, E to mark done and S to snooze, each
  with Undo. Home shows your issues by status, the inbox and the current sprint, and an issue
  opened from either steps through that list with J and K. Sign-in pages lead with your workspace
  and say "Powered by Bemmoly", tab titles name the page and the workspace, and a missing or broken
  page stays inside the frame with a way back. Once a workspace logo can be uploaded, it leads the
  sidebar with "on Bemmoly" under it. No configuration or schema change.

### Patch Changes

- 8f4df5f: The Board can now select cards like the Backlog: tick a card's corner, Shift-click for a range or
  ⌘-click for one more, and the same bar assigns, sets priority, moves to a sprint or deletes them
  with Undo. A Display menu on the Board lets each person choose the card fields, a compact density
  and whether empty columns show; it never changes the board for anyone else.

  Assigning, changing priority and moving to a sprint from a card, a row, the issue menu or the bulk
  bar now shows at once, dims the issue until the server answers, puts it back if the change is
  refused, and offers Undo. The Board, Backlog and Issue page show who else is looking at them.
  Issues can be linked from their menu on the Board and Backlog.

  Every icon button has the same tooltip, with its shortcut. Epics keep their colour on every
  screen, project and space tiles are drawn the same everywhere, and labels that shouted in
  capitals are now in sentence case. On a phone the Backlog keeps each issue's title and the
  sprint's name, and Board lanes keep the epic's name. Home's My issues moves with j and k, an issue
  created over a Scrum board joins the running sprint, and the loading screen follows the theme you
  last used.

  Someone who opens an issue in a project they are not a member of is now told so, and who can add
  them, instead of being told the server did not answer.

  Live updates and presence over the realtime connection are now limited to the people who can open
  the project or space, as the project and space lists already were.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 27dec1d: Docs arrives: spaces of pages your team writes together in real time, with comments, version
  history and live links to your issues. The module ships in the image, off until an admin
  enables it in Settings › Modules, and it works on its own: with Work disabled, or not in the
  image at all, every Docs screen and flow behaves the same, and issue chips print as their keys.

  **The Docs home and spaces.** /docs shows your spaces as cards, with their first pages, recent
  contributors and member count; the pages edited most recently, with where each sits
  ("Engineering / Architecture"), who last changed its text and the issues it references; your
  starred pages, drafts and pages in review; the templates to start from; and a Needs attention
  panel with the reviews you were asked for and the published pages you own that nobody has
  edited in `docs.staleAfterDays` (90 days by default). Before the first space exists the home is
  a short guide to making one. A space opens beside its page tree: open and close pages, drag a
  page above, below or into another (or use Alt and the arrow keys), rename with F2, star, copy a
  link, and move pages to the trash with Undo; each space has a trash to restore from. Whoever
  creates a space is its admin, a team's space includes the team, and space admins add and remove
  people and teams. Create › Page opens a picker with six built-in templates (RFC, meeting notes,
  postmortem, product spec, runbook and decision log); Create › Space is offered to people who
  hold "Create spaces". Pages also show in the ⌘K palette.

  **The doc editor.** A page opens with its place in the space, a status menu that walks the
  review flow (asking for review picks reviewers; publishing and archiving need publish rights),
  a save line ("Saved · Priya is editing"), who else is on the page, a star, Share and a menu to
  move or trash it. Type "/" for blocks: headings, lists, callouts, decisions, tables, images,
  code coloured by language, a table of contents, issue chips and issue tables from a saved
  filter. "[[" links a page and "#" finds an issue; with Work enabled, chips and tables show each
  issue's live status. An outline follows the text beside the body on wide screens, and the About
  panel holds status, owner, reviewers, labels and length. ⌘S says saving is automatic, ⌘. opens
  About and ⌘⌥M (Ctrl+Alt+M) comments on the selected words.

  **Writing together.** Two or more people edit one page at once, see each other's named cursors
  and never overwrite each other. Edits made offline stay in the tab and merge on return, undo
  only undoes your own changes, and people who may only view a space watch changes live. If the
  connection drops the save line says "Offline · changes kept", or "Reconnecting…" when the
  server is only taking a breath, and the page stays editable throughout.

  **Comments, history and linked work.** Comment on a whole page or on selected words; threads
  have replies, @mentions, edit and delete, and resolve or reopen. A comment follows its words
  through later edits and says "Text changed" when they go. A version is saved on publish, when
  you choose Save version, and every 30 minutes of editing; compare any two versions block by
  block, word by word and cell by cell, and restore one as a live edit that is itself kept as a
  version. Linked work lists the issues a page references with their live status, the records
  that reference it and the pages that link back, both ways and only what you may open.

  **Export and import.** Export a page as Markdown or self-contained HTML, or a page and its
  subpages as a zip. Import Markdown files and folders, or a Confluence space export, whose
  unknown macros become labelled blocks rather than being dropped; large imports run in the
  background. PDF export is not included yet.

  **Built to be quick and usable by everyone.** On a space of 1,000 pages the Docs home draws in
  about 70 ms after the app shell and a 20,000-word page paints in about 100 ms and is live in
  about 160 ms; typing stays under one frame. Every Docs screen is checked with axe against WCAG
  2.2 AA in light and dark (the theme's quieter text colours are the known exception), the tree,
  block menu, comments, status and history work from the keyboard alone, the save state is
  announced without chattering, and links in pages are underlined.

  Schema: enabling Docs runs the 15 changesets of its changelog, all additive. `0001-docs-spaces`
  (spaces, tied to the kernel's space membership tables), `0002-docs-templates`,
  `0003-docs-pages` (pages with tree paths, order, search and trigram indexes; it needs the
  `pg_trgm` extension, as Work does), `0004-docs-page-updates` (the Yjs update log),
  `0005-docs-page-state` (the compacted document), `0006-docs-page-revisions`,
  `0007-docs-page-comments`, `0008-docs-links` (the page and issue reference graph),
  `0009-docs-page-labels`, `0010-docs-page-stars`, `0011-docs-page-search-vector` (triggers that
  keep the search index), `0012-docs-default-templates` (seeds the six templates),
  `0013-docs-revision-tracking`, `0014-docs-space-members-backfill` (makes creators and team
  members members of spaces that predate membership) and `0015-docs-content-editor` (who last
  edited a page's body). Each is fast on a new install; each can be rolled back, and the rollback
  of `0014` keeps the memberships it added. Two workspace settings tune Docs:
  `docs.compactThreshold` (fold the update log after 500 updates) and `docs.staleAfterDays`.
