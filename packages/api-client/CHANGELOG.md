# @bemmoly/api-client

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 8337385: People you invite join as Viewer, the least-privileged role, unless you pick another role:
  in the setup wizard, in Users › Invite people, for a new team's default role and through the
  API, where `roleId` is now optional on `POST /api/v1/invitations`. Invited people now appear
  in Users as INVITED rows and count as invited, with Resend, Copy invite link and Revoke.
  After sending invitations, Bemmoly shows each person's sign-up link to copy and share, and
  says so plainly when outbound email is not set up yet; Copy invite link issues a fresh link
  later (the old one stops working). Invitation and password reset emails now link to pages
  that exist (`/accept-invitation` and `/reset-password`); links sent by earlier versions open
  a missing page, so resend those invitations or copy a new link. No configuration or schema
  change.
- 8337385: Fresh installs start with no module enabled. A module runs only once an admin enables it in
  Settings › Modules (or lists it in `BEMMOLY_MODULES`, which still pins the set). Enabling a
  module now asks "Who can use it?": Nobody yet (recommended; only org admins can open it),
  Everyone, or Specific teams. Nothing is granted that the admin did not choose; the access a
  module suggests is shown as a hint only. Access can be changed later under Users › Module
  access, and the audit log records the access chosen on enable. `bemmoly-db modules enable`
  takes `--access none|everyone|teams` and `--team <id>`, and defaults to none. The Sample
  module is a developer example: it stays in the image but is off until enabled and suggests no
  access. Existing installs keep the modules and grants they have; to turn Sample off, use
  Disable in Settings › Modules. No configuration or schema change.
