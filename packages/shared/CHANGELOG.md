## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 51cd3ae: Add the Bemmoly Query Language (LQL) parser that the Work module's filter bar, swimlane
  queries, saved filters and automation conditions share. A query such as
  `project = PLT AND status != Done AND assignee = me AND "spec doc" IS EMPTY ORDER BY updated DESC`
  is parsed into a syntax tree, checked against the issue fields (project, key, type, status,
  status category, priority, assignee, reporter, parent, epic, sprint, estimate, due, created,
  updated, fix version, label, text and `cf.<key>` for custom fields), and printed back in a
  canonical form so saved filters are stored one way. Mistakes come back with the exact position
  and what was expected, so the filter bar can underline them, and autocomplete offers the
  fields, operators, keywords and values that fit where the cursor is. Compiling a query to SQL
  lives in the Work module, not here. No configuration or schema change.

### Patch Changes

- e2aa5d2: The command palette (⌘K) now searches inside modules. The kernel serves `GET /api/v1/search`
  from search providers that modules register with `ctx.search.addProvider`; it asks only the
  modules a person can open, and each provider keeps to what that person may see. Work answers
  with issues by key (type `PLT-14`) and by keyword, each with its status and assignee, under an
  "Issues" group and scope. No configuration or schema change.

### Patch Changes

- 8337385: People you invite join as Viewer, the least-privileged role, unless you pick another role:
  in the setup wizard, in Users › Invite people, for a new team's default role and through the
  API, where `roleId` is now optional on `POST /api/v1/invitations`. Invited people now appear
  in Users as INVITED rows and count as invited, with Resend, Copy invite link and Revoke.
  After sending invitations, Bemmoly shows each person's sign-up link to copy and share, and
  says so plainly when outbound email is not set up yet; Copy invite link issues a fresh link
  later (the old one stops working). Invitation and password reset emails now link to pages
  that exist (`/accept-invitation` and `/reset-password`); links sent by earlier versions open
  a missing page, so resend those invitations or copy a new link. No configuration or schema
  change.
- 8337385: Fresh installs start with no module enabled. A module runs only once an admin enables it in
  Settings › Modules (or lists it in `BEMMOLY_MODULES`, which still pins the set). Enabling a
  module now asks "Who can use it?": Nobody yet (recommended; only org admins can open it),
  Everyone, or Specific teams. Nothing is granted that the admin did not choose; the access a
  module suggests is shown as a hint only. Access can be changed later under Users › Module
  access, and the audit log records the access chosen on enable. `bemmoly-db modules enable`
  takes `--access none|everyone|teams` and `--team <id>`, and defaults to none. The Sample
  module is a developer example: it stays in the image but is off until enabled and suggests no
  access. Existing installs keep the modules and grants they have; to turn Sample off, use
  Disable in Settings › Modules. No configuration or schema change.

### Minor Changes

- b403d58: Add email and in-app notifications. Every email goes through an outbox that retries with
  backoff and shows failures in plain words to admins; SMTP and a development `log` provider
  are built in, with a test send that checks SPF and DMARC. Emails are themed from the
  workspace brand colour and logo, say why they were sent, and carry a one-click unsubscribe
  link. Notifications land in the inbox and follow each person's preference per kind: email at
  once, a digest every few minutes or once a day, in-app only, or off.

  Schema: changesets `0200-email-outbox`, `0201-notifications` and
  `0202-notification-preferences` add `email_outbox`, `notifications`,
  `notification_preferences` and `notification_schedules`. Settings: `email.provider`
  (default `log`), `email.smtp.host`, `email.smtp.port`, `email.smtp.security`,
  `email.smtp.username`, `email.smtp.password` (secret), `email.from`, `email.replyTo`,
  `email.digestMinutes`.
