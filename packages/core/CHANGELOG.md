### Minor Changes

- b403d58: Add email and in-app notifications. Every email goes through an outbox that retries with
  backoff and shows failures in plain words to admins; SMTP and a development `log` provider
  are built in, with a test send that checks SPF and DMARC. Emails are themed from the
  workspace brand colour and logo, say why they were sent, and carry a one-click unsubscribe
  link. Notifications land in the inbox and follow each person's preference per kind: email at
  once, a digest every few minutes or once a day, in-app only, or off.

  Schema: changesets `0200-email-outbox`, `0201-notifications` and
  `0202-notification-preferences` add `email_outbox`, `notifications`,
  `notification_preferences` and `notification_schedules`. Settings: `email.provider`
  (default `log`), `email.smtp.host`, `email.smtp.port`, `email.smtp.security`,
  `email.smtp.username`, `email.smtp.password` (secret), `email.from`, `email.replyTo`,
  `email.digestMinutes`.

- c7e5a48: Settings are now guarded by the capability that owns them. Anyone holding a
  `workspace.*.manage` capability can read the settings list, and saving a key needs the
  capability for its group: `appearance.*` needs "Set appearance and themes"
  (`workspace.appearance.manage`), `email.*` needs `workspace.email.manage`, `system.*` needs
  `workspace.system.manage`, and every other workspace key needs `workspace.settings.manage`.
  People who were given only the appearance capability can now save the workspace look.
  Behaviour change: holding only `workspace.settings.manage` no longer lets someone change email
  or system settings; give them the email or system capability as well.

### Patch Changes

- 293b01b: The audit log now records settings, modules and backups, as Settings › Audit log says it does:
  `setting.updated` and `setting.reset` with the value before and after (secrets only as set or
  not set), `module.enabled`, `module.disabled` and `module.data_removed` with the module's state
  and the changesets reversed, and `backup.started`, `backup.verified`, `backup.restored` and
  `backup.restore_failed`. Each row is written in the same transaction as the change; a restore's
  row is written into the restored database once it finishes. A save that leaves a setting as it
  was writes no row.
