## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 0278663: Sign-in, password reset and invitation accept are now rate limited per account as well as per
  address. Before this fix, someone using many addresses could keep guessing one person's
  password, or keep sending them reset emails. Each account now gets 10 attempts per route every
  15 minutes, whether or not the address belongs to anyone, and the 11th gets `429 Too Many
Requests` with a `Retry-After` header. A real person locked out by someone else's guessing can
  sign in again when the 15 minutes are up. An address that keeps presenting session cookies or
  API tokens the server refuses is turned away for the rest of the minute after 60 refusals,
  before any more are checked; valid sessions and tokens never count against this.

  All limits stay on, and each maximum can now be set in the environment (empty keeps the
  default): `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_PER_USER` (API requests per person per minute, 600),
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_IP` (anonymous auth requests per address per route per minute, 10),
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_ACCOUNT` (attempts per account per route per 15 minutes, 10) and
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_FAILED_CREDENTIALS_PER_IP` (refused credentials per address per minute,
  60). Behind a reverse proxy, keep `BEMMOLY_TRUST_PROXY=true` so limits apply to client
  addresses rather than the proxy's. Also fixed: a few text helpers that could stall on unusual
  input with long runs of `/` or `@` now run in linear time. No schema change.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- b98d0c0: Settings › Updates has a "Check for updates" button that fetches the release list right away instead of waiting for the daily check, and the page says plainly when the list has never been fetched or the last check failed, rather than claiming you are on the latest release.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 8337385: People you invite join as Viewer, the least-privileged role, unless you pick another role:
  in the setup wizard, in Users › Invite people, for a new team's default role and through the
  API, where `roleId` is now optional on `POST /api/v1/invitations`. Invited people now appear
  in Users as INVITED rows and count as invited, with Resend, Copy invite link and Revoke.
  After sending invitations, Bemmoly shows each person's sign-up link to copy and share, and
  says so plainly when outbound email is not set up yet; Copy invite link issues a fresh link
  later (the old one stops working). Invitation and password reset emails now link to pages
  that exist (`/accept-invitation` and `/reset-password`); links sent by earlier versions open
  a missing page, so resend those invitations or copy a new link. No configuration or schema
  change.
- 8337385: Fresh installs start with no module enabled. A module runs only once an admin enables it in
  Settings › Modules (or lists it in `BEMMOLY_MODULES`, which still pins the set). Enabling a
  module now asks "Who can use it?": Nobody yet (recommended; only org admins can open it),
  Everyone, or Specific teams. Nothing is granted that the admin did not choose; the access a
  module suggests is shown as a hint only. Access can be changed later under Users › Module
  access, and the audit log records the access chosen on enable. `bemmoly-db modules enable`
  takes `--access none|everyone|teams` and `--team <id>`, and defaults to none. The Sample
  module is a developer example: it stays in the image but is off until enabled and suggests no
  access. Existing installs keep the modules and grants they have; to turn Sample off, use
  Disable in Settings › Modules. No configuration or schema change.

### Minor Changes

- b403d58: Add email and in-app notifications. Every email goes through an outbox that retries with
  backoff and shows failures in plain words to admins; SMTP and a development `log` provider
  are built in, with a test send that checks SPF and DMARC. Emails are themed from the
  workspace brand colour and logo, say why they were sent, and carry a one-click unsubscribe
  link. Notifications land in the inbox and follow each person's preference per kind: email at
  once, a digest every few minutes or once a day, in-app only, or off.

  Schema: changesets `0200-email-outbox`, `0201-notifications` and
  `0202-notification-preferences` add `email_outbox`, `notifications`,
  `notification_preferences` and `notification_schedules`. Settings: `email.provider`
  (default `log`), `email.smtp.host`, `email.smtp.port`, `email.smtp.security`,
  `email.smtp.username`, `email.smtp.password` (secret), `email.from`, `email.replyTo`,
  `email.digestMinutes`.

- c7e5a48: Settings are now guarded by the capability that owns them. Anyone holding a
  `workspace.*.manage` capability can read the settings list, and saving a key needs the
  capability for its group: `appearance.*` needs "Set appearance and themes"
  (`workspace.appearance.manage`), `email.*` needs `workspace.email.manage`, `system.*` needs
  `workspace.system.manage`, and every other workspace key needs `workspace.settings.manage`.
  People who were given only the appearance capability can now save the workspace look.
  Behaviour change: holding only `workspace.settings.manage` no longer lets someone change email
  or system settings; give them the email or system capability as well.

### Patch Changes

- 293b01b: The audit log now records settings, modules and backups, as Settings › Audit log says it does:
  `setting.updated` and `setting.reset` with the value before and after (secrets only as set or
  not set), `module.enabled`, `module.disabled` and `module.data_removed` with the module's state
  and the changesets reversed, and `backup.started`, `backup.verified`, `backup.restored` and
  `backup.restore_failed`. Each row is written in the same transaction as the change; a restore's
  row is written into the restored database once it finishes. A save that leaves a setting as it
  was writes no row.
