# @bemmoly/core

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e0e170: Images go into Docs pages by upload, not only by link. Paste a screenshot, drop a file, or pick
  Image from the / menu: the image uploads with its progress shown where it will land, a failed
  upload says why and offers Try again, and everyone else on the page sees it arrive live. A
  selected image's alt text is edited in place.

  Images are stored by Bemmoly as files of the page: people who can edit the page add them, people
  who can read it see them, and nobody else can open them. PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP are accepted,
  checked by their content rather than their name; SVG is refused. Uploaded images are kept under
  the data directory's attachments folder, so backups include them, and an image no page, version
  or template refers to any more is removed after a day by the housekeeping job. A page exported
  as HTML carries its images inside it, a page and its children exported as a folder carry them in
  an `images/` folder, and a single Markdown file keeps links to them.

  Configuration: `BEMMOLY_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` sets the largest upload (10 MiB by default) and
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_UPLOADS_PER_USER` the uploads a person may make per minute (30 by default).
  Schema: kernel changeset `0500-files` adds the `files` table (additive, fast).

- 4cbf7a1: Bemmoly now has a built-in MCP server, so AI desktop apps, coding agents and IDEs can work in
  your workspace as you. Point a client at `/mcp` for every module, or at `/mcp/work` or
  `/mcp/docs` for one. It offers search, the Work and Docs tools the palette uses, issues,
  projects, spaces and pages as readable resources, and two prompts. Every call runs with your
  permissions, writes land in the audit log, and requests are rate limited.

  An admin turns it on, and picks the modules it exposes, in Settings › MCP server. It is off by
  default, and the AI settings do not affect it. Everyone can create personal access tokens in
  Settings › Access tokens: read only or read and write, for every module or only some, shown once
  and stored as a hash. A token limited to some modules is held to them in the REST API too. See
  `docs/mcp.md` to connect a client.

- c4215a9: The updater now moves itself to the release it installs, verified with cosign like the app image, so updater fixes reach existing installs (ADR 0020). `bemmoly upgrade` does the same, and `bemmoly sync-updater` moves an older updater once. Clicking Update opens a dialog with each step's live status; every admin sees a running update, a second one is refused, and the page reloads onto the new version when it is ready.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0a04d0d: AI arrives, and it is optional. Bring any provider in the models.dev catalog, a gateway, or a
  model running on your own network, and Bemmoly summarises your work where you read it, answers
  questions from your docs with their sources, drafts in the doc editor and plans changes from
  ⌘K that run only when you confirm them. **AI is off until an admin turns it on, and nothing
  changes for a workspace that leaves it off:** no AI surface is drawn, every AI endpoint except
  the Settings › AI switch refuses, no AI background job runs, and the server makes no AI-related
  request to anyone.

  **Turning it on.** An admin opens Settings › AI and models (or the setup wizard's AI step, which
  also offers "Skip, no AI"), adds a provider from the catalog with its key, or a Local server by
  protocol and address, and presses Test connection, which reports the provider's own answer in
  plain words. Each model role (fast, standard, strong and embedding) then picks a model, with
  capabilities, context size, price and release date shown; a newly connected provider fills every
  empty role with its suggested model. One switch turns AI on for the whole workspace; turned off
  again, every AI surface disappears for everyone and the providers and roles are kept. Keys are
  encrypted with the install's secret key and never shown again. The provider list comes from the
  catalog fetched live by the server, then the last good copy, then the copy in the image; a status
  line says which, and an admin can upload a newer catalog or turn the live fetch off.

  **Summaries where you read.** Every AI card is drawn in the lilac reserved for AI, cites the issue,
  comment, section or page each claim came from, marks a claim without a source "Unsourced", and
  offers "Not useful". The issue page and slide-over say what an issue stands on, who it waits on
  and what it blocks. The Board and Backlog of a running sprint show one line naming the biggest
  risk, refreshed five quiet minutes after the sprint changes. A page's TL;DR sits under its title
  and is rewritten only when the text changes. Consistency checks run when a page is published and a
  minute after an issue it names changes, and show contradictions in the page's Linked work margin
  and in "Needs you" for its owner and reviewers. Home shows a morning brief of what changed in your
  projects and spaces since your last visit, written at 6 a.m. in your time zone. Summaries are
  cached and rewritten only when what they read changed; a failed one says so with Try again and
  never blocks the page.

  **Ask your docs.** With an embedding model set, the Docs home has a question box. The answer
  streams in with numbered citations that open the page at the heading, or the issue, they came
  from. It draws only on pages and issues you can open, checked again with the rules the rest of
  the app uses, combines meaning-based search with keyword search, and says so when nothing in the
  workspace answers instead of guessing. The index follows edits a few seconds after they settle,
  re-embeds only the sections that changed, and backfills when AI is turned on or the embedding
  model changes.

  **AI in the doc editor.** Pause at the end of a line and ghost text suggests how the sentence goes
  on; Tab keeps it, anything else drops it. Each person turns ghost text off for themselves with
  ··· › Ghost text suggestions, and the choice follows them to every device. The / menu's AI group
  and Ask AI on a selection continue, summarize, draft from a heading, improve, shorten, fix
  spelling, translate, turn text into a table or create issues from a section; the answer streams
  into a card below the text with Replace, Insert, Ask again, Discard and Not useful, and one undo
  takes an accepted answer back. An inline comment thread offers Suggest a fix, with Apply fix and
  Not useful on the fix it writes. Nothing AI writes reaches a shared page until someone accepts it,
  so people editing with you never see an unaccepted suggestion. None of this is drawn for readers,
  in a space excluded from AI, or for someone who turned AI off.

  **Plans from ⌘K.** Type a request such as "move everything blocked by PLT-204 to next sprint" and
  choose Plan with Bemmoly (Mod+Enter), or ask a question and get Ask Bemmoly's cited answer. **A
  plan changes nothing until you confirm it.** It lists each change, checked against your own
  permissions; a change you can't make is marked Denied with the reason and left out. Edit plan
  keeps fewer changes and Enter runs it. Each change lands in turn through the same code the app
  uses, keeps running if you close the palette, can be stopped, and Undo puts back everything that
  can be put back. Comments a plan writes are signed "via Bemmoly for" your name. With AI actions
  turned off a plan is a preview that never runs.

  **Privacy.** An admin chooses whether issue and doc content is sent at all (with it off, only
  titles, keys, statuses and field values), whether email addresses and names are replaced before
  sending, which spaces and projects are excluded (never sent, never embedded, and their AI actions
  hidden), whether AI actions may change data, and whether people may turn AI off for themselves
  from their Profile. Someone who opts out sees no AI, and their own writing is kept out of
  summaries other people read and out of the answer index.

  **Budget and cost.** Every AI call is logged with its cost in `ai_runs`, and Settings › AI › Usage
  shows this month's spend by role, purpose and model. An optional monthly budget tells admins at
  80% and again at 100%, in the inbox and by email; at 100% it pauses the standard and strong roles
  until the 1st, and the screens that use them say so in plain words. A call that is stopped or
  times out still counts, at an estimate of what was sent and received. Settings › System status
  shows this month's spend to people who configure AI. Every prompt can be
  overridden in Settings › AI › Prompts, compared with the default line by line and reset.

  Admins should know:

  - **Schema:** ten additive changesets: `0400-ai-providers`, `0401-ai-model-roles`,
    `0402-ai-runs`, `0403-ai-catalog-snapshots`, `0404-ai-prompt-overrides`, `0405-ai-insights`,
    `0406-ai-embeddings` (enables the `vector` extension, which the pgvector Postgres image every
    install runs already ships), `0407-ai-user-opt-outs`, `0408-ai-plans` (`ai_plans` and
    `ai_plan_steps`) and `0409-ai-user-preferences`. Nothing existing is altered.
  - **Settings:** `ai.enabled` (off), `ai.redactEmails` and `ai.redactNames` (off),
    `ai.excludedSpaceIds` and `ai.excludedProjectIds` (none), `ai.perUserOptOutAllowed` (off),
    `ai.monthlyBudgetUsd` (no budget) and `ai.liveCatalog` (on), all edited in Settings › AI. The
    wizard's existing `ai.shareContent` and `ai.allowActions` now take effect.
  - **Environment:** two new optional keys. `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_AI_PER_USER` sets how many requests a
    minute each person may make to each route that calls a model (60 by default; this covers answers,
    plans, summary refreshes, ghost text, /ai writes, suggested fixes and an admin's provider tests).
    `BEMMOLY_AI_RECORDING` is the absolute path of a JSON file of canned AI replies for end-to-end
    tests and demos; when set, no provider is ever called.
  - **Network:** a provider's address is checked on every call, not only when it is saved, and a
    provider that answers with a redirect is refused. A Local server may use loopback and your private
    network but never link-local addresses such as cloud metadata; `BEMMOLY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS` also
    lets a catalog provider's base URL sit on a private network. Server logs for a failed call keep
    the failure and the provider's words with any echoed key removed, never the prompt.
  - **Permissions:** every AI surface needs "Use AI assist" (roles without it, by default
    contractors, see no AI); running a plan needs "Run AI actions that change data" and "Let AI
    actions change data" on. Each step re-checks those permissions and the person's opt-out as it
    runs, Undo checks the person may still make that change, and a plan expires after an hour. Each step a plan makes writes an
    audit row (`ai.plan.step_run`, actor kind `ai_plan`) that names the plan.
  - **Jobs:** `ai.catalog.refresh` (daily, only while AI is on), `ai.insight`, `ai.brief` (hourly), `ai.plan.run`, and
    `ai.retrieval.index`, `ai.retrieval.reconcile` and `ai.retrieval.backfill` for the answer index.
  - **Notifications:** a new `ai_budget` kind reaches people who configure AI, by email by default.

  For module authors: `ctx.ai` offers `generate`, `stream` and `embed` through one facade, and
  `addTool`, `addContextBuilder`, `addInsightGenerator`, `addRetrievalSource`, `addPromptFile` and
  `addExclusionSource`. Streamed replies are NDJSON (ADR 0017), AI code that only lazy screens
  need sits behind subpath exports such as `@bemmoly/shared/ai-answers` (ADR 0018), and write
  tools only ever become plan steps a person confirms (ADR 0019). A module's event handlers run
  only while that module is enabled, so a disabled module never handles another's events.

### Patch Changes

- fc28637: Settings › Roles no longer lists "Manage billing and license". Nothing ever checked it, and
  Bemmoly has nothing to buy. Schema: the kernel changeset `0109-identity-drop-billing-capability`
  deletes the stored grants of `workspace.billing.manage` on update; it is quick and reversible.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2ab05df: Bemmoly takes on its logo's colours and a quieter visual system. The accent is the logo blue
  (the mid blue in dark mode), AI is the logo lilac and nothing else, and epics have their own
  violet. Every text grey now reads at 4.5:1 or better on every surface in every theme, so muted
  text that was hard to read is fixed everywhere at once, and the Midnight and Ocean themes get
  readable primary buttons. Type, radii and shadows are fewer and consistent.

  Icons are drawn instead of typed, so they look the same on every computer: issue types are
  tiles with a drawn mark, priority is three neutral bars with only the most urgent level in red,
  and keyboard shortcuts are drawn keys ("Ctrl" off Apple platforms). Custom issue types show
  their own icon and colour instead of a task's, and Settings › Issue types shows every type's
  icon rather than a stored character. Status pills follow their category, so In review and QA
  read as in progress (blue). Avatars are solid colours with white initials, labels are outlined
  pills with their own colour, and project, team and module tiles share one shape.

  Workspace logo colours no longer recolour the Bemmoly mark under a custom theme. Tooltips name
  their shortcut, deleting something reversible shows Undo for six seconds, relative times show
  the full date on hover, and every keyboard focus shows the same ring.

  Workflow status colours stored by earlier versions are drawn as their nearest new colour, and
  the issue type icon field now takes an icon name of up to 40 characters. No configuration or
  schema change.

- 8f4df5f: The Board can now select cards like the Backlog: tick a card's corner, Shift-click for a range or
  ⌘-click for one more, and the same bar assigns, sets priority, moves to a sprint or deletes them
  with Undo. A Display menu on the Board lets each person choose the card fields, a compact density
  and whether empty columns show; it never changes the board for anyone else.

  Assigning, changing priority and moving to a sprint from a card, a row, the issue menu or the bulk
  bar now shows at once, dims the issue until the server answers, puts it back if the change is
  refused, and offers Undo. The Board, Backlog and Issue page show who else is looking at them.
  Issues can be linked from their menu on the Board and Backlog.

  Every icon button has the same tooltip, with its shortcut. Epics keep their colour on every
  screen, project and space tiles are drawn the same everywhere, and labels that shouted in
  capitals are now in sentence case. On a phone the Backlog keeps each issue's title and the
  sprint's name, and Board lanes keep the epic's name. Home's My issues moves with j and k, an issue
  created over a Scrum board joins the running sprint, and the loading screen follows the theme you
  last used.

  Someone who opens an issue in a project they are not a member of is now told so, and who can add
  them, instead of being told the server did not answer.

  Live updates and presence over the realtime connection are now limited to the people who can open
  the project or space, as the project and space lists already were.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 27dec1d: The server now hosts live collaborative documents at `/collab`, on its own port and
  authenticated with the session cookie. Every change is stored in Postgres as it happens and
  survives restarts; a page's text, word count, search index and links update two seconds after
  typing stops.

  Two new optional environment keys cap each editing connection; empty keeps the default.
  `BEMMOLY_COLLAB_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES` is the largest message one socket may send, from 64 KiB to
  16 MiB (2 MiB by default). `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_COLLAB_MESSAGES` is how many document messages
  one socket may send per 10 seconds (1200 by default); caret and selection updates count
  separately, up to three times that, so moving the caret never spends the typing budget. A
  socket over a limit is closed and the editor reconnects on its own, keeping what was typed.
  Measured in a browser, the fastest key repeat with the caret moving sends about 70 messages a
  second, half of them carets, so the defaults leave room for two people typing flat out.

  Run one API process per install for live editing; with several, route `/collab` with session
  affinity. The bundled Caddy configuration keeps editing connections open across a
  configuration reload. No schema change.

- 27dec1d: For module authors and API clients, the kernel gains what let Docs and Work point at each
  other without importing each other. `ctx.entities.resolve` finds a record any enabled module
  registered, by id or key, filtered to what the person may see; `ctx.entities.resolveMany` does
  it for a whole list in one batch, and `EntitySummary` can carry the facts a renderer shows,
  such as an issue's status. `EntityDefinition.canView` now receives the request context.
  `ctx.links.addReferenceSource` and `ctx.links.referencesTo` answer "what points at this record"
  across modules, which is how an issue lists its linked docs. A module that ships
  `web/src/entities.tsx` lends a chip, card, table and search for the records it owns, and other
  modules' screens draw them through `useEntityRenderer(kind)`, keeping a placeholder while the
  owner is off. Work registers its issues, so Docs pages show live issue chips and tables. In the
  web kernel, `preloadable` and `useLoaded` load a lazy screen before rendering it, and module
  chunks now load that way, so opening a module no longer waits out React's 300 ms Suspense
  reveal.

  Deprecated: `PATCH /api/v1/docs/pages/:id` still accepts `snapshot` and applies it as one live
  edit, but write page bodies through `/collab`; the field is removed in 0.4. No configuration or
  schema change.

### Minor Changes

- dcbcae4: Modules can now write the kernel's audit log. The module context carries an audit recorder
  whenever the database is present, so a module records who created a project or overrode a
  scheme in the same audit log that settings changes use, inside its own transaction. No
  configuration or schema change.
- 7d09c70: Modules can now manage who belongs to a project or a space. The module context carries a
  membership service whenever the database is present: list the members with their role, add
  people or whole teams (each team member takes the team's default role, everyone else Member,
  unless a role is named), change a member's role and remove a member, inside the module's own
  transaction. Access follows on the next request, since authorization reads membership every
  time. No configuration or schema change.
- d313831: The Work module ships in the image, off until an admin enables it in Settings › Modules.
  Enabling it runs its schema changelog, which creates the issue tracking tables (projects,
  issue types and fields, workflows, issues, links, labels, versions, components, sprints,
  boards, saved filters, comments, history, work logs, watchers, attachments and automation
  rules) and adds the pg_trgm extension for prefix search, which needs the database owner or a
  superuser to have created it on managed databases that do not allow trusted extensions. Once
  enabled, "Board" and "Backlog" appear in the top navigation as placeholders and the Work
  capabilities (create and configure projects; view, create, edit, move and delete issues;
  manage sprints; configure the board) appear in the roles matrix with their defaults. The
  screens and the API behind them arrive in later changes of this release. No configuration
  change.

### Patch Changes

- e2aa5d2: The command palette (⌘K) now searches inside modules. The kernel serves `GET /api/v1/search`
  from search providers that modules register with `ctx.search.addProvider`; it asks only the
  modules a person can open, and each provider keeps to what that person may see. Work answers
  with issues by key (type `PLT-14`) and by keyword, each with its status and assignee, under an
  "Issues" group and scope. No configuration or schema change.
- 158db6a: Fixes found by the end-to-end Work flows. Page loads no longer count against the strict
  ten-a-minute limit for sign-in and setup, which locked everyone behind one office address out
  with "Too many requests". Mentioning someone in an issue description now notifies them, as a
  mention in a comment does. On the board, a card moved twice in a row is judged by the
  transitions of its current status, a card dropped with the keyboard keeps the focus, a card
  dropped on a column's refusal note says why it stays, quick moves no longer jump back while
  the server catches up, and a link to a project you cannot see says so instead of inviting you
  to create one. Realtime updates refetch only what changed, and an issue's activity now reads
  "created the issue" rather than "changed created". No configuration or schema change.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- a13da15: Fix people behind one shared address (an office network) being locked out with "This page did not load". The web app reads the setup status on every page load, and that read counted against the strict sign-in limit of ten requests a minute per address. It now counts against the ordinary per-person budget; creating the first admin stays strictly limited.
- @bemmoly/shared@0.1.6
  - @bemmoly/ui@0.1.6

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 0278663: Sign-in, password reset and invitation accept are now rate limited per account as well as per
  address. Before this fix, someone using many addresses could keep guessing one person's
  password, or keep sending them reset emails. Each account now gets 10 attempts per route every
  15 minutes, whether or not the address belongs to anyone, and the 11th gets `429 Too Many
Requests` with a `Retry-After` header. A real person locked out by someone else's guessing can
  sign in again when the 15 minutes are up. An address that keeps presenting session cookies or
  API tokens the server refuses is turned away for the rest of the minute after 60 refusals,
  before any more are checked; valid sessions and tokens never count against this.

  All limits stay on, and each maximum can now be set in the environment (empty keeps the
  default): `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_PER_USER` (API requests per person per minute, 600),
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_IP` (anonymous auth requests per address per route per minute, 10),
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_ACCOUNT` (attempts per account per route per 15 minutes, 10) and
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_FAILED_CREDENTIALS_PER_IP` (refused credentials per address per minute,
  60). Behind a reverse proxy, keep `BEMMOLY_TRUST_PROXY=true` so limits apply to client
  addresses rather than the proxy's. Also fixed: a few text helpers that could stall on unusual
  input with long runs of `/` or `@` now run in linear time. No schema change.

### Patch Changes

- 8337385: People you invite join as Viewer, the least-privileged role, unless you pick another role:
  in the setup wizard, in Users › Invite people, for a new team's default role and through the
  API, where `roleId` is now optional on `POST /api/v1/invitations`. Invited people now appear
  in Users as INVITED rows and count as invited, with Resend, Copy invite link and Revoke.
  After sending invitations, Bemmoly shows each person's sign-up link to copy and share, and
  says so plainly when outbound email is not set up yet; Copy invite link issues a fresh link
  later (the old one stops working). Invitation and password reset emails now link to pages
  that exist (`/accept-invitation` and `/reset-password`); links sent by earlier versions open
  a missing page, so resend those invitations or copy a new link. No configuration or schema
  change.
- 8337385: Fresh installs start with no module enabled. A module runs only once an admin enables it in
  Settings › Modules (or lists it in `BEMMOLY_MODULES`, which still pins the set). Enabling a
  module now asks "Who can use it?": Nobody yet (recommended; only org admins can open it),
  Everyone, or Specific teams. Nothing is granted that the admin did not choose; the access a
  module suggests is shown as a hint only. Access can be changed later under Users › Module
  access, and the audit log records the access chosen on enable. `bemmoly-db modules enable`
  takes `--access none|everyone|teams` and `--team <id>`, and defaults to none. The Sample
  module is a developer example: it stays in the image but is off until enabled and suggests no
  access. Existing installs keep the modules and grants they have; to turn Sample off, use
  Disable in Settings › Modules. No configuration or schema change.

### Minor Changes

- b403d58: Add email and in-app notifications. Every email goes through an outbox that retries with
  backoff and shows failures in plain words to admins; SMTP and a development `log` provider
  are built in, with a test send that checks SPF and DMARC. Emails are themed from the
  workspace brand colour and logo, say why they were sent, and carry a one-click unsubscribe
  link. Notifications land in the inbox and follow each person's preference per kind: email at
  once, a digest every few minutes or once a day, in-app only, or off.

  Schema: changesets `0200-email-outbox`, `0201-notifications` and
  `0202-notification-preferences` add `email_outbox`, `notifications`,
  `notification_preferences` and `notification_schedules`. Settings: `email.provider`
  (default `log`), `email.smtp.host`, `email.smtp.port`, `email.smtp.security`,
  `email.smtp.username`, `email.smtp.password` (secret), `email.from`, `email.replyTo`,
  `email.digestMinutes`.

- c7e5a48: Settings are now guarded by the capability that owns them. Anyone holding a
  `workspace.*.manage` capability can read the settings list, and saving a key needs the
  capability for its group: `appearance.*` needs "Set appearance and themes"
  (`workspace.appearance.manage`), `email.*` needs `workspace.email.manage`, `system.*` needs
  `workspace.system.manage`, and every other workspace key needs `workspace.settings.manage`.
  People who were given only the appearance capability can now save the workspace look.
  Behaviour change: holding only `workspace.settings.manage` no longer lets someone change email
  or system settings; give them the email or system capability as well.

### Patch Changes

- 293b01b: The audit log now records settings, modules and backups, as Settings › Audit log says it does:
  `setting.updated` and `setting.reset` with the value before and after (secrets only as set or
  not set), `module.enabled`, `module.disabled` and `module.data_removed` with the module's state
  and the changesets reversed, and `backup.started`, `backup.verified`, `backup.restored` and
  `backup.restore_failed`. Each row is written in the same transaction as the change; a restore's
  row is written into the restored database once it finishes. A save that leaves a setting as it
  was writes no row.
