### Patch Changes

- e2aa5d2: Home now shows sections from the modules you can open, above "Your modules". A module adds one
  by shipping `web/src/home.tsx`; a section that fails to load shows a retry card and leaves the
  rest of Home working. Work adds "My work": the issues assigned to you, reported by you and
  watched by you, each tab with its count, served by `GET /api/v1/work/my-issues`. No
  configuration or schema change.
- 7625bb6: Unsaved work in Work settings is no longer lost when leaving through the top bar, Back or a
  typed address. Board settings with an unsaved draft shows its unsaved-changes bar and waits for
  Keep editing or Discard and leave; the dialogs that add an issue type or a custom field ask
  before dropping a name that was typed; the workflow editor finishes saving the draft before it
  leaves, and asks only when that save fails. Modules get the same guard the workspace settings
  pages use, so any module page can hold a move away from unsaved work. No configuration or
  schema change.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 0278663: Sign-in, password reset and invitation accept are now rate limited per account as well as per
  address. Before this fix, someone using many addresses could keep guessing one person's
  password, or keep sending them reset emails. Each account now gets 10 attempts per route every
  15 minutes, whether or not the address belongs to anyone, and the 11th gets `429 Too Many
Requests` with a `Retry-After` header. A real person locked out by someone else's guessing can
  sign in again when the 15 minutes are up. An address that keeps presenting session cookies or
  API tokens the server refuses is turned away for the rest of the minute after 60 refusals,
  before any more are checked; valid sessions and tokens never count against this.

  All limits stay on, and each maximum can now be set in the environment (empty keeps the
  default): `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_PER_USER` (API requests per person per minute, 600),
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_IP` (anonymous auth requests per address per route per minute, 10),
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_ACCOUNT` (attempts per account per route per 15 minutes, 10) and
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_FAILED_CREDENTIALS_PER_IP` (refused credentials per address per minute,
  60). Behind a reverse proxy, keep `BEMMOLY_TRUST_PROXY=true` so limits apply to client
  addresses rather than the proxy's. Also fixed: a few text helpers that could stall on unusual
  input with long runs of `/` or `@` now run in linear time. No schema change.
