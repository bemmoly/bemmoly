### Minor Changes

- 2ab05df: Bemmoly takes on its logo's colours and a quieter visual system. The accent is the logo blue
  (the mid blue in dark mode), AI is the logo lilac and nothing else, and epics have their own
  violet. Every text grey now reads at 4.5:1 or better on every surface in every theme, so muted
  text that was hard to read is fixed everywhere at once, and the Midnight and Ocean themes get
  readable primary buttons. Type, radii and shadows are fewer and consistent.

  Icons are drawn instead of typed, so they look the same on every computer: issue types are
  tiles with a drawn mark, priority is three neutral bars with only the most urgent level in red,
  and keyboard shortcuts are drawn keys ("Ctrl" off Apple platforms). Custom issue types show
  their own icon and colour instead of a task's, and Settings › Issue types shows every type's
  icon rather than a stored character. Status pills follow their category, so In review and QA
  read as in progress (blue). Avatars are solid colours with white initials, labels are outlined
  pills with their own colour, and project, team and module tiles share one shape.

  Workspace logo colours no longer recolour the Bemmoly mark under a custom theme. Tooltips name
  their shortcut, deleting something reversible shows Undo for six seconds, relative times show
  the full date on hover, and every keyboard focus shows the same ring.

  Workflow status colours stored by earlier versions are drawn as their nearest new colour, and
  the issue type icon field now takes an icon name of up to 40 characters. No configuration or
  schema change.

- 8f4df5f: The Board can now select cards like the Backlog: tick a card's corner, Shift-click for a range or
  ⌘-click for one more, and the same bar assigns, sets priority, moves to a sprint or deletes them
  with Undo. A Display menu on the Board lets each person choose the card fields, a compact density
  and whether empty columns show; it never changes the board for anyone else.

  Assigning, changing priority and moving to a sprint from a card, a row, the issue menu or the bulk
  bar now shows at once, dims the issue until the server answers, puts it back if the change is
  refused, and offers Undo. The Board, Backlog and Issue page show who else is looking at them.
  Issues can be linked from their menu on the Board and Backlog.

  Every icon button has the same tooltip, with its shortcut. Epics keep their colour on every
  screen, project and space tiles are drawn the same everywhere, and labels that shouted in
  capitals are now in sentence case. On a phone the Backlog keeps each issue's title and the
  sprint's name, and Board lanes keep the epic's name. Home's My issues moves with j and k, an issue
  created over a Scrum board joins the running sprint, and the loading screen follows the theme you
  last used.

  Someone who opens an issue in a project they are not a member of is now told so, and who can add
  them, instead of being told the server did not answer.

  Live updates and presence over the realtime connection are now limited to the people who can open
  the project or space, as the project and space lists already were.

- 259e195: Every signed-in screen now sits in one frame: a sidebar with the Bemmoly mark and your workspace,
  Search and New, Home, Inbox and My issues, then Work's projects with their Board, Backlog and
  Settings and Docs' spaces, with Settings, Help, the version and your account at the foot. The top
  bar is gone. Press `[` to fold the sidebar to a narrow rail (it remembers), and on a phone the
  sidebar opens from the menu button with a bottom bar for Home, Inbox, New and My issues. Settings
  use the same sidebar, and Esc takes you back to where you were.

  Creating opens over the page you are on instead of taking you elsewhere. ⌘K shows what you opened
  recently and what the current screen can do, Tab filters it by type, and `?` lists every
  shortcut, including C for a new issue, `/` to search and G chords to move between places.

  The Inbox is a two-pane triage view: Mentions, Reviews and Assigned segments, items grouped by
  day, the issue itself beside each item, and J/K to move, E to mark done and S to snooze, each
  with Undo. Home shows your issues by status, the inbox and the current sprint, and an issue
  opened from either steps through that list with J and K. Sign-in pages lead with your workspace
  and say "Powered by Bemmoly", tab titles name the page and the workspace, and a missing or broken
  page stays inside the frame with a way back. Once a workspace logo can be uploaded, it leads the
  sidebar with "on Bemmoly" under it. No configuration or schema change.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 27dec1d: For module authors and API clients, the kernel gains what let Docs and Work point at each
  other without importing each other. `ctx.entities.resolve` finds a record any enabled module
  registered, by id or key, filtered to what the person may see; `ctx.entities.resolveMany` does
  it for a whole list in one batch, and `EntitySummary` can carry the facts a renderer shows,
  such as an issue's status. `EntityDefinition.canView` now receives the request context.
  `ctx.links.addReferenceSource` and `ctx.links.referencesTo` answer "what points at this record"
  across modules, which is how an issue lists its linked docs. A module that ships
  `web/src/entities.tsx` lends a chip, card, table and search for the records it owns, and other
  modules' screens draw them through `useEntityRenderer(kind)`, keeping a placeholder while the
  owner is off. Work registers its issues, so Docs pages show live issue chips and tables. In the
  web kernel, `preloadable` and `useLoaded` load a lazy screen before rendering it, and module
  chunks now load that way, so opening a module no longer waits out React's 300 ms Suspense
  reveal.

  Deprecated: `PATCH /api/v1/docs/pages/:id` still accepts `snapshot` and applies it as one live
  edit, but write page bodies through `/collab`; the field is removed in 0.4. No configuration or
  schema change.

## 0.2.0

### Patch Changes

- e2aa5d2: Home now shows sections from the modules you can open, above "Your modules". A module adds one
  by shipping `web/src/home.tsx`; a section that fails to load shows a retry card and leaves the
  rest of Home working. Work adds "My work": the issues assigned to you, reported by you and
  watched by you, each tab with its count, served by `GET /api/v1/work/my-issues`. No
  configuration or schema change.
- 7625bb6: Unsaved work in Work settings is no longer lost when leaving through the top bar, Back or a
  typed address. Board settings with an unsaved draft shows its unsaved-changes bar and waits for
  Keep editing or Discard and leave; the dialogs that add an issue type or a custom field ask
  before dropping a name that was typed; the workflow editor finishes saving the draft before it
  leaves, and asks only when that save fails. Modules get the same guard the workspace settings
  pages use, so any module page can hold a move away from unsaved work. No configuration or
  schema change.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 0278663: Sign-in, password reset and invitation accept are now rate limited per account as well as per
  address. Before this fix, someone using many addresses could keep guessing one person's
  password, or keep sending them reset emails. Each account now gets 10 attempts per route every
  15 minutes, whether or not the address belongs to anyone, and the 11th gets `429 Too Many
Requests` with a `Retry-After` header. A real person locked out by someone else's guessing can
  sign in again when the 15 minutes are up. An address that keeps presenting session cookies or
  API tokens the server refuses is turned away for the rest of the minute after 60 refusals,
  before any more are checked; valid sessions and tokens never count against this.

  All limits stay on, and each maximum can now be set in the environment (empty keeps the
  default): `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_PER_USER` (API requests per person per minute, 600),
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_IP` (anonymous auth requests per address per route per minute, 10),
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_ACCOUNT` (attempts per account per route per 15 minutes, 10) and
  `BEMMOLY_RATE_LIMIT_FAILED_CREDENTIALS_PER_IP` (refused credentials per address per minute,
  60). Behind a reverse proxy, keep `BEMMOLY_TRUST_PROXY=true` so limits apply to client
  addresses rather than the proxy's. Also fixed: a few text helpers that could stall on unusual
  input with long runs of `/` or `@` now run in linear time. No schema change.
